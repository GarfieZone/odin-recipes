        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Used in many Japanese recipes, this stock is made from kombu (dried kelp), bonito flakes (shaved skipjack tuna), sardine, or a combination of all or two of them which creates a unique umami flavor.</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>0.7 oz kombu</li>
            <li>3 cups katsuobushi</li>
            <li>4 cups water</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Gently clean the kombu with a damp cloth, without removing the white powdery “umami” substances. Make a couple of slits on the kombu.</li>
            <li>Put the kombu and water in a saucepan and soak for 2-3 hours (at least 30 minutes).</li>
            <li>Slowly bring to a boil over medium low heat. Just before boiling, turn off the heat and remove the kombu. If you don’t remove the kombu, the dashi will become slimy and bitter.</li>
            <li>Let the dashi cool a bit. Add the katsuobushi and bring it to a boil again. Once the dashi is boiling, reduce the heat and simmer for 30 seconds. Turn off the heat and let the katsuobushi sink to the bottom, about 10 minutes.</li>
            <li>Strain the dashi through a sieve lined with a paper towel set over a bowl. Gently twist and squeeze the paper towel to release the extra dashi into the bowl.</li>
        </ol>
