        <h2>Disclaimer</h2>
        <p>The content of this website is from <a href="https://www.justonecookbook.com/">Just One Cookbook</a>, a Japanese cooking site that I like.
        The purpose of this website is to practice and demonstrate the skills I have learned so far in the <a href="https://www.theodinproject.com">The Oden Project</a> cirriculum,
        mostly skills of HTML and Git.
        If you stumble upon this website, don't use it for the recipes. I will be linking to the original pages which contain comprehensive information about preparing these dishes.
        Go there instead! Thank you :)</p>
